# Chicago Air Quality Monitoring System — Version 2
[Project Link](https://chicagoairqualityprediction.vercel.app/)
(It can take upto 40s to connect to mongodb since it is deployed on free instance of vercel)
This repository contains the updated, **end-to-end implementation** of a Chicago air quality monitoring and prediction system.  
The project was originally built as a frontend-only visualization tool (V1).  
**Version 2** expands it into a full **data engineering and machine learning pipeline**.

## 📊 Overview of V1 (Previous Version)

**Repository:** [https://github.com/Tilak2203/Chicago-air-quality-vercel](https://github.com/Tilak2203/Chicago-air-quality-vercel)

The earlier version (V1) consisted of:

- A React application
- Direct API calls to fetch PM2.5 readings
- Basic data visualization
- No automated data pipeline
- No backend
- No stored history
- No machine learning predictions

### Limitations of V1:

- Data was fetched only at runtime
- No long-term storage or historical dataset
- No ETL or cleaning
- No prediction capability
- The entire system existed only on the frontend

---

## 🚀 Overview of V2 (Current Version)

Version 2 transitions the project to a **proper end-to-end pipeline**.  
It separates ingestion, processing, storage, prediction, API serving, and frontend visualization into **independent components**.

### Key Changes:

- ✅ Added **Airflow ETL pipeline** for scheduled data ingestion and cleaning
- ✅ Introduced **MongoDB Atlas** as the primary database
- ✅ Added a **Python backend** to serve data and predictions through REST APIs
- ✅ Implemented a **machine learning model (RandomForest)** for PM2.5 forecasting
- ✅ Rebuilt the frontend to use backend APIs instead of direct external calls
- ✅ Centralized timestamp handling and preprocessing
- ✅ Organized the project into a **modular, production-style structure**

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

The system now follows a **straightforward pipeline**:

1. **Airflow** fetches PM2.5 data on a schedule, cleans it, normalizes timestamps, removes duplicates, and loads it into MongoDB.

2. **MongoDB Atlas** stores historical and latest readings.

3. **The Python backend** exposes REST endpoints for:
   - All cleaned readings
   - Prediction results
   - Prediction history
   - Model performance metrics

4. A **RandomForest model** provides next-hour PM2.5 predictions.

5. **The React frontend** consumes backend APIs, visualizes trends, allows date filtering, and displays predictions.

This mirrors a standard data engineering workflow:  
**ingest → clean → store → predict → serve → visualize**

## 🛠️ Running the System Locally

### 1. Start Airflow

```bash
cd airflow-docker
docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd Chicago-air-quality-render
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Backend runs at:** `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd Chicago-air-quality-vercel
npm install
npm start
```

**Frontend runs at:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎯 Purpose of V2

This version provides a more **realistic demonstration** of data engineering and machine learning concepts:

- ✔️ Automated, repeatable ingestion
- ✔️ Centralized cloud database
- ✔️ A reusable API layer
- ✔️ Prediction workflows
- ✔️ A clean separation between ETL, backend, and frontend

The system is **maintainable, extendable, and reflects real-world architecture**.
